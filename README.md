Assignment for the subject **Service Oriented Systems** (SOS) of the Technical University of Madrid.

The assignment was to try and make an API for a social network, where you only need to have in mind that there are users, posts and friends.

The database is in the *database.sql* file, where all the entities are defined, as well as some examples. 

All the logic is in the *API.java* file, who calls to the *DatabaseQuery.java* file, who is in charge of making all the diferent queries. 

Finally, we provide a client to test all the different methods.
